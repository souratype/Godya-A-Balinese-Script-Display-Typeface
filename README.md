Godya — Balinese Display Typeface

Godya is an open-source Balinese script typeface with a display-oriented sans-serif style.  
This typeface was independently designed and developed by a student as part of an internship project.

## Project Background

Godya was created through personal research and experimentation in Balinese script typography.  
The project explores contemporary visual expression while respecting the cultural foundation of the Balinese writing system.

This typeface is **not an official, academic, or authoritative standard** of Balinese script usage.  
It is an experimental and expressive design intended for display purposes.
